You just want something that works, reduces errors, improves accuracy, and can integrate with your downstream systems.<br /></p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<p>Last year, Canon embraced AI and automation alongside human-in-the-loop capabilities, to drive their digital transformation and offloaded 8,800+ hours annually from their Finance teams in both the USA and Canada. This year they are nearing that outcome with even more intelligent document processing! Taking the learnings from previous projects and supporting an AI-powered automation strategy across business teams, Canon employees are being upskilled and redeployed to more interesting and engaging work and business-impacting projects.</p>\n",
